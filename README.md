# Supabase Video Optimiser

A script for optimising videos kept in Supabase storage.

It compresses `.mp4` files and creates and uploads `.m3u8` variants of each video.
It was written to compress videos to be used in mobile apps.

## Usage

Run the script with:

```text
npx supabase-video-optimiser --url <PROJECT-URL> --key <SERVICE-ROLE-KEY> --bucket videos --folder public
```

This will compress video files and re-upload them to Supabase, along with HLS
versions.

You can check the results of the compression by looking in the `./videos` folder.

The following command line arguments are available.
